Alternatively, you can add configuration in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [],
    "servers": {
      "mcp-server-code-runner": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "mcp-server-code-runner@latest"
        ],
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### npx for Claude Desktop

Configuration in `claude_desktop_config.json`: 

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-code-runner": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-server-code-runner@latest"
      ],
    }

Alternatively, you can add configuration in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [],
    "servers": {
      "mcp-server-code-runner": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--rm",

          "formulahendry/mcp-server-code-runner"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### npx issue on Widnows

On Windows, [MCP servers may fail to connect with `npx`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/40).

You could try below two workarounds:

#### use bunx

1. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).
2. In configuration, change `npx` with `bunx`.

#### use cmd

Below is VS Code configuration in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "inputs": [],
    "servers": {
      "mcp-server-code-runner": {
        "command": "cmd",
        "args": [
          "/c",
          "npx",
          "-y",
          "mcp-server-code-runner@latest"
        ],
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Run with [Streamable HTTP Transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http)

```shell
npm install -g mcp-server-code-runner@latest
mcp-server-code-runner --transport http
```

## Usage

Before using Code Runner MCP Server, please make sure interpreter or compiler of the programming language you want to run is set in `PATH` environment variable.

Try below prompts in the application which has configured Code Runner MCP Server:

* `Run the JavaScript Code: console.log(5+6)`
* `Where is temporary folder in my OS? Use run-code tool`
* `How many CPUs do I have in my machine? Use run-code tool`
